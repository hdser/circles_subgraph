# Circles UBI Path Explorer & Subgraph

This repository contains two main components: a **Circles V2 Subgraph** for indexing data from the Circles V2 protocol and a **Circles Path Explorer**, a visualization tool that consumes the data from the subgraph to display information about Circles paths.

This project provides a comprehensive solution for exploring and understanding the flow of Circles, a Universal Basic Income (UBI) project on the Gnosis chain. By combining a powerful data indexing layer with an intuitive visualization interface, users can gain insights into the trust relationships and transaction pathways that form the backbone of the Circles economy.

## üèõÔ∏è Circles V2 Subgraph

The subgraph is a custom data indexing solution built using The Graph Protocol. It listens to events emitted by the Circles V2 smart contracts and stores this data in a structured and easily queryable format. This allows the frontend application to efficiently retrieve complex data about user balances, trust relationships, and transfers.

### Key Files

  * **`subgraph.yaml`**: The main configuration file that defines which smart contracts to listen to, which events to track, and how to map that data to the schema.
  * **`schema.graphql`**: Defines the data schema for the subgraph, including the structure of entities such as Avatars, Trusts, and Transfers.
  * **`src/`**: Contains the AssemblyScript code that handles the business logic for transforming the event data from the smart contracts into the entities defined in the schema.

## üé® Circles Path Explorer

The Circles Path Explorer is a modern, responsive web application built with React and TypeScript. It provides a user-friendly interface for visualizing and exploring the paths of Circles transfers between different accounts. Users can search for specific addresses or transaction hashes to see detailed information about the flow of Circles.

### Application Structure

  * **`src/components/`**: A collection of reusable React components that make up the user interface. This includes common elements like tooltips and loading spinners, layout components, and specialized components for displaying path information.
  * **`src/hooks/`**: Custom React hooks that encapsulate the logic for fetching and managing data from the subgraph.
  * **`src/pages/`**: The main pages of the application, such as the home page and the detailed views for addresses and transactions.
  * **`src/services/`**: Contains the GraphQL client and queries for interacting with the subgraph, as well as the logic for transforming the data for visualization.
  * **`src/utils/`**: Utility functions for formatting data, defining constants, and other helper logic.

## üöÄ Getting Started

To get the project up and running on your local machine, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites

  * Node.js
  * Yarn
  * Docker

### Installation & Setup

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone <repository-url>
    cd <repository-directory>
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies for both projects:**

    ```bash
    # For the subgraph
    cd circles-v-2-hub
    yarn install

    # For the frontend
    cd ../circles-path-explorer
    yarn install
    ```

3.  **Run the subgraph locally:**

    ```bash
    cd ../circles-v-2-hub
    docker-compose up
    ```

4.  **Start the frontend development server:**

    ```bash
    cd ../circles-path-explorer
    yarn dev
    ```

You should now be able to access the Circles Path Explorer in your browser at `http://localhost:5173`.
